    <h2 class="headers2">About Me</h2>
    <p>Technology and learning new skills are my passion, it is where I can get creative and develop my ideas.<br>
        I am very motivated and reliable, I take my work very seriously. I can work either on my own or as a part of the team.<br>
        I can adapt to any environment and I would use all my skills to contribute positively to any work situation</p>
    <p>In my spare time, I have been working on a couple of individual projects, specifically using Visual Studio IDE.<br>
        The main programming language I have used since NC is C#. I have also expanded my interests by doing a little bit of practice of Python and AWS technologies such as VM’s.</p>
